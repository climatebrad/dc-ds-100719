    "Assume you are superintendent of public schools for the city in which you live. Recently, local citizens have been concerned that the reading program in the public schools may be an inferior one. Since this is a serious issue, you decide to conduct an experiment to investigate the matter. You set $\\alpha = 0.05$ one-tail test for making your decision. You begin by comparing the reading level of current high school seniors with established norms. The norms are based on scores from a reading proficiency test administered nationally to a large number of high school seniors. Using the data blow write null and alternative hypotheses to understand whether there is any significant difference between the school district and national kids."
